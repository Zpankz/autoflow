# Vasopressor Pharmacology in Critical Care

## Overview

Vasopressor agents are essential medications in critical care medicine, particularly for the management of septic shock and other distributive shock states. These agents work by activating adrenergic receptors to restore vascular tone and improve systemic perfusion.

## First-Line Vasopressors

### Norepinephrine (Levophed)

**Mechanism of Action:**
Norepinephrine is a potent alpha-1 and beta-1 adrenergic agonist with minimal beta-2 activity. It primarily causes peripheral vasoconstriction through alpha-1 receptor activation while providing mild cardiac stimulation via beta-1 receptors.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
- **Onset:** 1-2 minutes after IV administration
- **Half-life:** 2-3 minutes
- **Metabolism:** Rapidly metabolized by monoamine oxidase and catechol-O-methyltransferase
- **Elimination:** Primarily hepatic with renal excretion of metabolites

**Clinical Applications:**
- First-line vasopressor for septic shock
- Distributive shock states
- Neurogenic shock
- Hypotension refractory to fluid resuscitation

**Dosing:**
- **Initial dose:** 0.01-0.03 mcg/kg/min (typically 5-10 mcg/min for 70kg adult)
- **Maintenance:** 0.05-2 mcg/kg/min
- **Maximum:** Generally limited to 3-5 mcg/kg/min due to peripheral ischemia risk

### Epinephrine (Adrenaline)

**Mechanism of Action:**
Non-selective adrenergic agonist with potent alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1, and beta-2 receptor activity. Provides both vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic effects.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
- **Onset:** 1-2 minutes IV
- **Half-life:** 2-3 minutes
- **Distribution:** Does not cross blood-brain barrier effectively
- **Metabolism:** Hepatic via MAO and COMT

**Clinical Applications:**
- Second-line vasopressor when norepinephrine fails
- Anaphylactic shock (first-line)
- Cardiac arrest resuscitation
- Severe bronchospasm with shock

## Second-Line Vasopressors

### Vasopressin (Antidiuretic Hormone)

**Mechanism of Action:**
Synthetic analog of antidiuretic hormone that acts on V1 receptors in vascular smooth muscle, causing vasoconstriction independent of adrenergic pathways.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
- **Onset:** 10-20 minutes
- **Half-life:** 10-35 minutes
- **Metabolism:** Hepatic and renal
- **Elimination:** Renal excretion

**Clinical Applications:**
- Catecholamine-resistant shock
- Hepatorenal syndrome
- Diabetes insipidus
- Adjunct to norepinephrine in refractory shock

**Dosing:**
- **Shock:** 0.01-0.04 units/min (fixed dose, not titrated)
- **Maximum:** 0.04 units/min to avoid ischemic complications

### Phenylephrine (Neo-Synephrine)

**Mechanism of Action:**
Pure alpha-1 adrenergic agonist causing selective peripheral vasoconstriction without direct cardiac effects.

**Clinical Applications:**
- Hypotension with adequate cardiac output
- Neuraxial anesthesia-induced hypotension
- Alternative when tachyarrhythmias limit other vasopressors

## Monitoring Parameters

### Hemodynamic Targets
- **Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP):** ≥65 mmHg
- **Central Venous Pressure (CVP):** 8-12 mmHg
- **Cardiac Index:** ≥2.5 L/min/m²
- **Mixed Venous Oxygen Saturation:** ≥70%

### Laboratory Monitoring
- **Lactate levels:** Target <2 mmol/L
- **Base deficit:** Target normalization
- **Urine output:** ≥0.5 mL/kg/hr
- **Liver function:** Monitor transaminases with high-dose vasopressors

## Adverse Effects and Contraindications

### Common Adverse Effects
- **Peripheral ischemia:** Risk increases with higher doses
- **Digital necrosis:** Particularly with prolonged high-dose therapy
- **Cardiac arrhythmias:** More common with epinephrine
- **Myocardial ischemia:** Risk with underlying coronary disease

### Relative Contraindications
- **Severe peripheral vascular disease**
- **Uncorrected hypovolemia**
- **Ventricular arrhythmias**
- **Monoamine oxidase inhibitor therapy**

## Clinical Guidelines

Based on current Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines:

1. **Fluid resuscitation** should be attempted before vasopressor initiation
2. **Norepinephrine** is the first-line vasopressor for septic shock
3. **Vasopressin** can be added to norepinephrine rather than replacing it
4. **Central venous access** is preferred for vasopressor administration
5. **Arterial line monitoring** is recommended for continuous blood pressure monitoring

## Drug Interactions

### Significant Interactions
- **MAO inhibitors:** Prolonged and enhanced response
- **Tricyclic antidepressants:** Enhanced pressor response
- **Beta-blockers:** May lead to unopposed alpha stimulation
- **Alpha-blockers:** Reduced vasoconstrictive effect

## Future Considerations

Emerging concepts in vasopressor therapy include:
- **Angiotensin II** for catecholamine-resistant shock
- **Methylene blue** for vasoplegia
- **Terlipressin** as alternative to vasopressin
- **Personalized dosing** based on genetic polymorphisms
